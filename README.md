The increased number of vehicles on the roads and express highways has led to an increase in the number of accidents in the whole of the United States. Saving human life is important. But, a road accident is often accompanied by infrastructure loss, traffic delays, and management of resources to clear the accident spot. 
This project was built on the **business scenario to facilitate Cityâ€™s Transportation Management Center (TMC)** to predict the traffic delay level, post road accidents, and effectively deploy their resources. 

A countrywide car accident database from February 2016 to June 2020 has been used as the [data source](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents). Several multivariate statistical techniques have been utilized to classify the impact of the accident on traffic delays. Predictive models were developed using ordinal logistic regression, binomial logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, discriminant analysis, decision tree and random forest algorithms. K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is considered as the best model for this data with high sensitivity and specificity. 

A conscious effort has been made in building a model with the input variables, whose data will be available when an accident is reported at TMC.
